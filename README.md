## Project Description:
- Yoked is a specialized fitness application designed exclusively for bodybuilders and powerlifters. It serves as a comprehensive solution for tracking workouts, fostering social engagement, and providing detailed analytics to support your strength journey.

- Our web application, now referred to as a Progressive Web App (PWA), offers a mobile app-like experience without requiring an internet connection. While it doesn't function offline, it provides a more visually appealing interface compared to standard browser views.

- Please note that certain features, such as geo-tracking and direct URL handling, may be limited on iOS devices due to platform restrictions.

## Key Features:
- **Workout Tracking:** Log exercises, sets, reps, and weight with the option to attach progress photos.
- **Meals Tracking:** Log meals and track key nutrients.
- **Stats Page:** View max deadlift, bench, and squat, along with fun stats about your meals and gym attendance.
- **Profile Page:** Store and view images, input bio data (age, height, sex, weight), and receive personalized information on daily caloric and nutrient needs.
- **Social Engagement:** Connect with friends, compare stats, and stay motivated together.
- **Calendar View:** Visualize workout history and access past routines effortlessly.
